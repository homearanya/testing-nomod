      text: We decided to pick an ambitious new name (a play on nomad) to reflect our new direction. Whilst we're deeply focused on building an incredibly good face to face payments experience, with thoughtful features, bringing on new ways to get paid, and continuing to expand into new markets, our longer term ambition is build a better banking experience for your business.

      text: But we're getting ahead of ourselves! Our pricing of 0.7% on every charge will remain the same, our codebase has improved and are our features are better thought out, with lots more including support for Teams on the way. Lunatap will continue to be available for the foreseeable future so that your workflow is not be disrupted. If for example, you use Stripe Terminal, please continue to use Lunatap, whilst we build support for Terminal.

        - Lunatap will no longer be in active development, and instead all of our efforts will be focused on turning Nomod into a ridiculously great payments experience (and perhaps the best thing since sliced bread, but we'll let you be the judge of that!), and eventually into an exciting financial services offering.
        - We really really appreciate your support thus far (all 4000 of you and counting!), and hope that you'll continue to join us on the journey!
        - Onwards,
        - <strong>The Recently Rebranded Folks at Nomod</strong>
