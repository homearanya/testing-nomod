# Cookie Policy

<span class="date">Version 1.1, 29th March 2020</span>

Like most websites and apps, we use cookies. By using the Nomod website and apps you agree to our use of cookies.

### 🍪 What are Cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your device when you use an app or a site is loaded in your browser.

### 🤔 Why do we use Cookies?

Cookies help us remember your preferences. A good way to think about cookies is that they’re like stickers. Every time you visit a site or app that uses cookies, the site puts a sticker on you to keep track of how many times you’ve visited, how much time you’ve spent there, and what you’ve done. This lets the site show you things that are relevant to you, based on the information you’ve entered, and the things that you’ve looked at.

### 🤖 Storage and Types of Cookies

Cookies can be stored on your device anywhere from a few minutes through to two years.

We use a few different types of cookies:

- Session cookies

- Persistent cookies

- Third-party cookies

We never use cookies to store your banking details.

### ✅ Session & Persistent Cookies

Session and persistent cookies track what you’re doing during a specific visit. We use session cookies to improve our site and apps, to give you a better experience. Session cookies let us see where you spend your time, and work out which areas are most effective. We use persistent cookies to recognise you when you come back. When we spot that it’s you, we’re able to show you the things that we think you may like.

### 🤝 Third-Party Cookies

Third-party cookies show you ads for things we think you’ll be interested in. For example, if you visit Nomod.com and look at information about a particular product, we may use cookies to show you ads about that product because we think it’s something you may be interested in.

We also use third party cookies to find out if the ads we run encourage more people to visit our site and use our apps. Third-party cookies work by sharing your browser identification with a third party (for example, Twitter), so they can show you ads on their sites and apps. These cookies can be session specific or persistent.

### ✂️ Turning off Cookies

If you’d prefer not to use cookies, you can turn them off. Exactly how to do so depends on your browser or device settings. Try looking in your “Help” section, or searching for “How to block cookies”.

If you turn cookies off, you may continue to see ads for Nomod, but they’ll be general, and not based on your specific information.
