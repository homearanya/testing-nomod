    - heading: This app has sped up our card payment process times 10 fold, without any exaggeration!
      text: It is a very simple Point of Sale app that our business was lacking due to expensive costs elsewhere. This app is very fast to use with NFC capabilities. It is extremely easy to use, anyone can open the app and use it without training. It is also cheaper than regular card machines and has no contracts.

      text: We wanted to take credit card payments at an event, without making a large capital investment. This app fit the need perfectly! Quick, responsive app. Does everything required to take credit card payments, and very reasonable cost, the lowest percentage transaction fees I think I’ve seen. Great customer support as well, when we tried to use it on a legacy device.
